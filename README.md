# Datawrapper

## Fairfax Datawrapper (fork)

This is a fork from v1.9.3 master, however it is not identical to datawrapper.de v1.9.3 - don't ask why..., only they  know.

This repo is maintained by [Marc Moncrief](mmoncrief@fairfaxmedia.com.au) and [Peter Borbely](pborbely@fairfaxmedia.com.au) 

___Note:__ Main branch is set to __dev__, which  is the ffx development branch!
The branch named *develop* is the original repo (datawrapper.de) development branch and must not be confused.

## UPDATE
Starting 15 June 2015, a one month sprint of evaluation development cycle to establish the viability of datawrapper as a long-term data / charting solution for specific tasks. See https://drive.google.com/open?id=1J4DUQCrJDhNUBSYgVcdBBYet7eIMAYeYZ3fqLSdghUw&authuser=0 for initial PRD.

Since the initial fork, datawrapper 1.9.5 has been released on github. 
For accurate evaluation, this latest (as of 15 June 2015) release will also be fetched.

Due to this change, the local dev environment is now mapped to teh following remotes:

"fork: git@github.com:datafunk/datawrapper.git (was origin for v1.9.3)
"datafx": git@bitbucket.org:fairfax/datafx.git (renamed repo of datawrapper - this is the repo to contribute to)
"upstream": git@github.com:datawrapper/datawrapper.git (new remote added to fetch v1.9.5)

## About datawrapper.de

Datawrapper is a tool that enables anyone to create visualizations in seconds, without any programming skills.

It draws inspiration from [ManyEyes](http://www-958.ibm.com/software/data/cognos/manyeyes/) and [GoogleCharts](https://developers.google.com/chart/) but remains entirely open-source and independent from a third-party server.

It was created by [Mirko Lorenz](http://www.mirkolorenz.com/), [Nicolas Kayser-Bril](http://nkb.fr) and [Gregor Aisch](http://driven-by-data.net/) and was funded by [ABZV](http://www.abzv.de/).
